  summary:
    "When I'm not programming at my computer, you can catch me lifting weights, hooping, playing badminton, cracking jokes with friends, eating great asian food, attempting to master a new hobby, or appreciating the small beautiful things in life. At the end of 2024, I experienced some monumental events that have driven me to pursue my career with passion, purpose, and ethics. I've learned to take in every moment fully and I want to connect with others and use tech to make people's lives better.",
